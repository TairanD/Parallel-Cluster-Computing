# High Performance Computing 1

## 1 - Parallel Computing
### 1.1 - Sequential Execution
- Traditional software is written for **serial(sequential) computation**.
  - where each task is broken into a series of [instruction](concepts.md), which are executed in sequence (one after another)
  - **Only one** instruction may execute an any moment

### 1.2 - Parallel Execution
In parallel computing, we use multiple compute resources **at the same time** to solve a **_single_** problem.
- Requires multiple processors, or a single processor with multiple cores, or GPUs

Q: can one processor (CPU) manage multiple lines of instructions (threads) ?
