Process:
- An instance of program (= running program), which includes 
  - the program's code
  - data
  - resources such as memory
  - I/O 
  devices while it's executing.
- Each process has its own memory space and runs independently of other processes, although they may interact through 
inter-process communication mechanisms.

Instruction:
- Instructions are the basic operations that a processor can perform. These instructions are encoded in binary format 
and represent specific actions that the processor can take, 
such as arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction), and logical operations (AND, OR).
- Instructions are fetched from memory by the processor, decoded to determine their meaning, and then executed.

Thread:
- A thread is a sequence (list) of instructions.

Processor:
- The processor, also known as the central processing unit (CPU), is the hardware component responsible for executing instructions, while a process is an 
instance of a program running on the processor. The processor manages the execution of processes and ensures that they
run efficiently and independently.




synchronisation
1. codes are executed line by line, if one part of the code is block, the whole program is blocked ? Synchronous Programming
2. The coordination of parallel tasks in real time. Usually, this results in a parallel task waiting until
another reaches a specific point before continuing
